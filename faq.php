<h3> Who are we? </h3>
<img src="clemson.png" width="200" height="200" align="center">
<p>We are a group of Clemson Computer Science majors that are actively looking to use our knowledge to better solve problems in our communities.
One of the many issues we wanted to tackle was the problem of unsafe driving. As we all know, car accidents is one of the leading causes of death in America
and it has disportionately affected the youth. So we came up with a good driver incentive program that we hope will reduce problems and promote good driving habits.</p>
<br>
<h3> What is our program?</h3>
<p> We have decided to create a web application that will promote good driving behavior on the road. The idea is simple- drivers will get sponsors 
who will give out points to said driver based upon the sponsor's criteria of a good driver. The driver will be able to redeem the points from Ebay and 
purchase products. </p>
<h3> How many sponsors can a Driver have? </h3>
<p> A driver can have as many sponsors as they want, provided that the sponsor is willing to sponsor them </p>
<br>
<h3> What can I use my points for? </h3>
<p> You can use your points to redeem items from your Sponsor's catalog. Each sponsor will have his or her own catalog full of items that you can purcahse with 
your points. </p>
<br>
<h3> How do I get points? </h3>
<p> Each sponsor will have his or her own criteria for obtaining points. Upon fulfilment of task, the sponsor will reward the driver points. </p>
<br>
<h3> Can I use points from sponsor A to buy products from sponsor B? </h3>
<p> No, points earned from one Sponsor does not carry over to another sponsor. </p>
<br>
<h3> How do I get a sponsor? </h3>
<p> In order to obtain a sponsor, a driver must first send a request to a sponsor they want. The sponsor will then look over the request and either accept the driver
or reject the driver </p>
